# Manage Students

This section lists all students admitted to your school and provides search and filtering tools to help you locate a specific student or a group of students.

For each student, you have the following options: **View Student Account**, **Edit Student**, and **Delete Student** (if there are no records associated with him/her).

You also have the option to **Add Student**, but we recommend using the *Import* feature as it automates **Relative Registration** and **Classroom Admission** for you.

## View Student Account

To view a student's account, click the student icon as shown in Figure 1 below.

### Basic Info

This section displays all basic student information, such as names and date of birth.

### Family Info

Here you will find a list of the student's relatives and siblings. You also have the ability to link additional relatives and siblings.

1. Click **Link Relative** to link, for example, a mother.
2. If the relative was registered before, search by name or phone number in the **Select Relative** box, or use **Add New** to register a new relative.
3. Select the **Relation** with this student (e.g., *Mother*) and tick **Is Primary Contact** if you want to send payment notifications and other automatic messages to this relative.
4. Click **Add** to finish.

To add a **Sibling**, make sure they are registered as a student first. Then click **Link Sibling**, select the sibling, and click **Add**.

### Documents

This section allows you to attach all documents related to this student, including the birth certificate and other documents.

### Classrooms

Here you will see a list of all **Classrooms** the student has attended at your school. The topmost will be the current class the student is admitted to. If you need to change the student's class, close the active class first, then use the **Class Admission** button to admit them to another **Classroom**.

### Exam Results

This section provides a summary of the student's previous exam results, and you can filter the results as needed.

### Bill & Payments
