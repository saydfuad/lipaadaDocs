# Manage Teachers

The Teachers section displays a list of all registered teachers, but it does not provide a way to add a new teacher. This is because **LIPA ADA** treats teachers as **Users**, as they are required to post **Student** results. To create a teacher profile, navigate to **Manage Users** and add them from there. Refer to the **User Management** guide for more details.

For a complete **Teacher Profile**, including work performance, leave management, payroll, and attendance monitoring, contact **ZMOTION SOLUTIONS** to acquire the **Human Resource Module**.
