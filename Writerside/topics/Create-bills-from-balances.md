# Create Bills from Balances

This section enables you to load bill balances from an Excel file into **LIPA ADA**. This functionality is provided to assist with migrating all student bill balances from your previous system to **LIPA ADA**.

Follow these steps to load bills:

1. Navigate to **Bills** and click **Load from file**.
2. Select the **Classroom** and **Academic Year**, then click **Filter**.
3. The system will generate an Excel file listing all students from the selected **Classroom**. Click **Download** and open the file in an Excel program.
4. Enter the balance for each student and input `0` for those with no pending bill balance.
5. Return to **LIPA ADA**, choose the updated file, and click **Upload Bills**.
6. The bills will be created, and the system will redirect you to the bills list.
