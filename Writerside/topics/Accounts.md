# Accounts
**LIPA ADA** is a comprehensive accounting system that provides flexibility to create multiple accounts for separating your revenues. For example, you can create separate accounts for **School Fee** and **Transport**, and have them appear individually in the income statement report.

To simplify this process, follow these steps to add a new account and focus on the types of accounts you need:

1. Navigate to **Accounts** and click **Add Account** to open the form.
2. Enter the account name (e.g., **School Fees**) and select **Operating Revenue** as the type.
3. Click **Add** to save the account.

**Note:** Initially, focus on two types of accounts: **Operating Revenue** and **Operating Expenses**. Use **Operating Revenue** accounts to create fee items within the **Fee Structure** and for **Products** sold outside the fee structure. **Operating Expenses** accounts are used for creating **Discounts**. See the **Products** section for more details on this.
