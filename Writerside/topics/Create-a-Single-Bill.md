- **Expire Date:** This setting allows you to specify a deadline by which the parent must clear the bill. The expire date will be included in the SMS sent to them.

- **Payment Option:** This setting provides two options:
    - **PARTIAL:** Allows the payment to be made in installments.
    - **EXACT:** Requires the payment to be made in full at once.
