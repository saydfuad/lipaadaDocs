# Products

In **LIPA ADA**, a **Product** refers to any item you add to a student’s bill. While items in the **Fee Structure** are also products, this section specifically displays products that are not part of the classroom fee structure. Examples include extra uniforms, study tours, and other additional items. Discounts are also considered products, as they can be applied to reduce the bill amount.

When you navigate to **Add Bill** and open the bill editor, you will find a search box on the right side where you can search for and add these products, including those created as fee structure items, to the student’s bill.
