# Create Bulk Bills

This section is typically used to generate bills at the beginning of the year or term. The process depends on whether you have created a single group under the fee structure for a single bill (control number) throughout the year or multiple groups for generating separate bills for each term.

To create bills for all or selected students in a particular **Classroom**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Bills** and click **Add Bulk Bills**.
2. Choose the **Classroom**, **Academic Year**, and **Group**.![bulk1.png](bulk1.png)
3. The system will list all students from the selected **Classroom** for the chosen **Academic Year**.
4. **Select All** students by clicking the checkbox at the table heading, or select specific students for whom you need to generate bills.
5. Click **Generate** to create bills. _Note: System will skip all student with similar bill in selected **Academic Year**_
6. The bills will be created and system will redirect you to bills list

**Note:** The student selection feature allows you to bulk generate bills for specific students if bill is not mandatory for all students, such as transport or boarding bills otherwise select all students.

**Also** When generating a bill, you have the option to configure the **expire date** and **payment option** as optional settings.

- **Expire Date:** This setting allows you to specify a deadline by which the parent must clear the bill. The expire date will be included in the SMS sent to them.

- **Payment Option:** This setting provides two options:
    - **PARTIAL:** Allows the payment to be made in installments.
    - **EXACT:** Requires the payment to be made in full at once.
