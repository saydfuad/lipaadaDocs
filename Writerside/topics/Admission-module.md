# Admission Module

---

This module allows schools to streamline their admission process by enabling online applications. Schools can easily share their application link with parents through advertisements and social media, making the process accessible and convenient.

In addition to facilitating online payments, the module implements robust financial controls, ensuring a smooth and secure transaction process.

The module also provides essential tools for managing the admission process, including scheduling interviews, assessing students, and assigning them to the appropriate classrooms. Throughout the process, parents receive timely updates via SMS, keeping them informed about the status of their child's application.



_**Note:** To ensure this module functions correctly, you need to create an **Operating Revenue** account and set it as the default account for recording admission revenue. This can be done under Administrator Settings. Although we typically set this up for you, please double-check to ensure itâ€™s configured to meet your specific needs._
