# Setup

To begin setting up the **Student Records** module, navigate to the **SETUP** section and follow these steps:

## Classroom Registration
To start using **LIPA ADA** you must have list of **Classroom** as per your school.

1. Click on **Classes** and then select **Add Classroom** as shown in Figure 1 below. Fill in the required details: **Classroom Name**, **Level**, **Number of Terms**, **Report Card Design**, and set the **Status** to *ACTIVE*.
2. If your **Classroom** has only one **Stream**, click **Add** to create the classroom. If it has multiple streams, proceed to **Streams** and add each stream (e.g., *A*, *B*, etc.).
3. We will return later to assign a **Class Teacher** and verify subjects, but this is not necessary for the initial setup.
