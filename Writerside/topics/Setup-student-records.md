# Setup

To begin setting up the **Student Records** module, navigate to the **SETUP** section and follow these steps:

## Classroom Registration
To start using **LIPA ADA** you must have list of **Classroom** as per your school.

1. Click on **Classes** and then select **Add Classroom** as shown in Figure 1 below. Fill in the required details: **Classroom Name**, **Level**, **Number of Terms**, **Report Card Design**, and set the **Status** to *ACTIVE*.
2. If your **Classroom** has only one **Stream**, click **Add** to create the classroom. If it has multiple streams, proceed to **Streams** and add each stream (e.g., *A*, *B*, etc.).
3. We will return later to assign a **Class Teacher** and verify subjects, but this is not necessary for the initial setup.

## Student Import

We provide an easy way to import your students from an Excel file. Follow the steps below to complete the process:

1. Navigate to **Student Import** and download the provided **Template**.
2. Use the template to fill in the student records according to the specified columns in the Excel file.
3. Return to **LIPA ADA** and upload the updated file. Select the appropriate **Classroom**, **Stream**, and **Academic Year**.
4. Click **Import** to validate and import the data. If there are any errors, the system will display helpful information to guide you through the next steps.

**Note:** *You must fill a separate file for each **Stream** within the same **Classroom***

## Subjects Registration

Adding **Subjects** to a **Classroom** is not mandatory to start using **LIPA ADA** Finance and **Admission** modules, but it is necessary if you need to track student results.

To start adding **Subjects**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Subjects** and click **Add Subject**.
2. Fill in the form as shown in Figure 2 below. Important fields to consider:
    - **Subject Name**: This should match the name of the same subject across all **Classrooms**.
    - **Classroom**: Select the **Classroom** where you want to add this **Subject**.
    - **Subject Code**: For example, for English taught in Grade 6, you could use **ENG6**.
3. We have grouped subject marking into **TEST 1**, **TEST 2**, and **EXAM**. Define the percentage weight for each as needed.
4. Under **Classification**, choose **Mandatory** if the **Subject** is required and will be considered when evaluating student performance.
5. If you have already registered users as **Teachers**, you can assign a teacher to this subject for the selected class, but this is not mandatory at this stage.**Note:** *Only teacher assigned to subject can post results using **Direct Post***
6. Click **Add** to finish adding the **Subject**. Repeat the process for all other **Subjects** in the same class.

## Grade Setup

**LIPA ADA** uses your grading system to analyze results and provide valuable insights into student performance. Since this is a one-time setup, take extra time to ensure accuracy.

Setting up the grading system is straightforward; just follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Grade** and click **Add Grade**.
2. A box will open, allowing you to choose a **Grading System Structure**. Select **Level Based Grading**, which is common for most situations.
3. Choose the relevant **Level** (e.g., Secondary).
4. Enter the **Minimum** and **Maximum** values for the range, and under **Symbol**, enter the grade (e.g., A, B, C).
5. Use the **Definition** field to add a remark for the grade (e.g., **EXCELLENT** for grade **A**).

**Note:** When adding grades for a particular **Level**, ensure that the minimum and maximum values cover all possible marks that a student might achieve. For example, if you set the minimum as 0 and the maximum as 34 for **F**, and then set the minimum as 36 and the maximum as 54 for **D**, you will miss the grade for a student who scores 35, as it wouldn't fall within any of the defined ranges.

## Report Card Comments

Instead of manually writing comments on each student's report card, **LIPA ADA** allows you to predefine comments based on a range of student scores. These comments can be set separately for the **Head Teacher (Principal)** and the **Class Teacher**.

To set up predefined report card comments, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Report Comments** and click **Add Comment**.
2. Select the **Level** (e.g., **Secondary**) and choose whether the comment is for the **Principal** or the **Class Teacher**.
3. Write the actual comment you want to appear on the report card.
4. Enter the **Minimum** and **Maximum** average score range that will trigger this comment to appear on a student's report card.
5. Repeat this process for each possible score range, as shown in Figure 4 below.
