# Applications

---

This section lists all applications submitted by parents, allowing you to filter them by status to view **PAID** and **UNPAID (NEW)** applications and also filter them by **Classroom**. Next to each application entry, there is a **Decision** button that opens a **Decision Box**. This box provides options to either call for an interview, proceed with further processing, or reject the application (see Figures 1 & 2 below).

Additionally, this section enables you to make bulk decisions. You can select multiple applications using the checkboxes at the beginning of each entry and then click the **Bulk Decision** button located in the top right corner of the section as shown in figure 3.
