# Payments

This section displays payment entries as they are made by parents. You can search by control number, receipt number, or the transaction reference sent via SMS by the mobile operator or bank to verify any payment or print a receipt if requested by a parent.

This search feature is also used to monitor incoming payments, with the latest payments shown at the top.
