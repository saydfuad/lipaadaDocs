1. Navigate to **Fee Structure** and click the **Fee Structure** button for each **Classroom** to add fee items, as illustrated in Figure 1.![fin_f2.png](fin_f2.png) Figure 1
2. Utilize **Groups** to categorize related fee items for billing purposes. For example, if you need to issue two separate bills for a student each year—one for the **FIRST TERM** and one for the **LAST TERM**—create groups with these names. Assign all fee items due in the first term to the **FIRST TERM** group and those due in the second term to the **LAST TERM** group. This setup allows you to generate two distinct bills for each term. see figure 1 & figure 2 ![groups.png](groups.png) Figure 2
3. Navigate to **Bills** here you will be provided with three (3) ways to create bill **Add Bill** is for student admitted at the middle of term or year, **Add Bulk Bill** is for generating bills to all or selected students in a classroom at once, **Load from file** is for adding bill as per balance from your previous system when you are migrating to **LIPA ADA**
