# Finance Module

The Finance module offers a secure and comprehensive billing and payment system, giving you a clear and detailed view of your schoolâ€™s financial status.

By default, the module is set to an easy mode for simplicity, but you can request the full accounting mode to access advanced features, including direct ledger postings and complete financial reporting.

To begin using this module ensure these two steps are done:
1. You have registered all your classroom under **Student Records Module** 
2. You have imported your students under **Student Records Module** or Admitted them under **Admission Module**

Bills are managed using control numbers for streamlined payments. Provide the control number to parents and instruct them to use it as a payment reference.
