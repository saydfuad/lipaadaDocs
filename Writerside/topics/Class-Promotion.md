# Class Promotion


This section enables you to promote students from a lower class to an upper class or to graduation. For example, if you have students in **STD 1** and it's a new academic year, and you need to move them to **STD 2**, this is the place to do that.

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Class Promotion**, select the source class that you need to promote, and click the arrow to pull in the list of students.
2. Ensure that your academic year setup is greater than the selected **Classroom** academic yearâ€”students cannot be promoted within the same year.
3. Select the students you need to promote, or select all.
4. Choose the destination **Classroom** and click **Process**.

**Note:** Tick **Is final class** this is a final class at your school for student you are promoting
