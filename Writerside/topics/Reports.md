# Reports

**LIPA ADA** provides all the essential reports by default, giving you a comprehensive overview of your financial status. Additional reports become available when you activate full accounting mode.

In this section, we will explore the usefulness of each report and how they can provide insights into your school's financial situation. All reports offer options to print and export to an Excel file.

1. **Payment Report:** This report lists all payments received within a chosen date range, along with their total value. You can further filter this report by bill **Group** and **Classroom**. Use this report to see how much you've collected over a particular period and narrow it down by **Group** or **Classroom** as needed.

2. **Bank Reconciliation Report:** This report pulls in transactions sent to the bank. You can filter transactions by **Payment Date** (the date when payment was received) or **Bank Date** (the date when the payment was sent to your bank account).

3. **Account Statement:** This report allows you to check the opening and closing balances of each of your accounts. For example, if you need to see how much **Transport Revenue** you've collected over a specific period, select the account and date range.

4. **Student Statement:** This report provides a complete status of a student's account, including all bills created and payments made during the selected time. Use this report to trace bills and payments for a student from different bills created at different times.

5. **Bill Report:** This is the master report for bill tracking and sending reminders to parents. It allows you to view pending bills for students in a particular **Classroom**, with options to filter by **Stream** and **Academic Year**. When you select any bill or multiple bills by clicking the checkbox next to each bill, the system will provide an extra button at the top right corner to send a reminder to parents about the pending bills.
